Are you a government official or interested citizen who wants to draft an open-data policy for your own place or agency? You have come to the right place!

We recommend that you [explore](/browse/) the policies on this site to get a sense of the kind of language other places have used in their policies. We encourage you to [download](/downloads/) the policies and copy, paste, and remix the content as you please.

We also have several web resources you should check out:

- [Open Data Policy Guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/opendataguidelines/) — This is a set of guidelines to address: what data should be public, how to make data public, and how to implement policy.
- [Open Data Policy Wizard](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2BeXHF-vkjbfmYRK0dIxYtWyaXUCkgG0a6twAIqRdwJM8dg/viewform) — Use this form to help you create an open-data policy! When you're done, you will get an email with your sample policy. This is intended to provide you with a "firestarter" for you to work off of and customize for your own place or agency's needs. Please do not just take the result blindly — read through the policy and make sure you understand all the parts, then fine-tune it to meet your needs. In the spirit of transparency, if you propose this policy, we strongly encourage you to cite where you got this sample text from (the Sunlight Foundation).
- [Public Policy for Public Data](http://whatworkscities.sunlightfoundation.com/) — A step-by-step checklist and resource guide for creating open-data policy.
